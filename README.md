Representing DNA for Machine Learning Algorithms: A Primer on One-Hot, Binary, and Integer Encodings

Jupyter Notebook of three popular methods for encoding DNA sequences: one-hot encoding, binary encoding, and integer encoding. DNA sequence encoding is an essential step in various bioinformatics and computational biology applications, enabling efficient representation and analysis of genetic data. Each encoding technique transforms the nucleotide-based DNA sequence into a numeric or binary representation, allowing for further computational processing and analysis.

We hope that you find the Jupyter Notebook interface easy to use and that it enhances your learning experience. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
